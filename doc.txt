---------
New version:
TODO:
- create X players using swfObject (youtube api) and move them around
- retrieve titles and put them in a dropdown. When selecting a title, load the video
- use previous and next buttons to move between videos
- add options
  - limit
  - player size
  - play when loaded
  - pagination (prev, next) video

--------------



limit to 1,
create only one player and move it around

Bug:
it doesn't work here
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1329665/

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054997/

check why it doesn't work with ratings

Ideas:
- think of watchlist and mark as watched features
- hide all others
- make options above and between videos ... this way, no need to scroll up
- follow actors
- follow movie
